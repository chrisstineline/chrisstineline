## Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on PantMig, HackTheGPT, an AGI/RSI design
    - I got bored and made **AN** --unnamed-- Algorithm:  a budget-constrained Markov chain optimizer using simulated annealing with adaptive temperature control and stability detection. It solves optimization problems where evaluation budget is limited—a critical constraint in real-world scenarios like neural architecture search, molecular discovery, and supply chain optimization.
  Unique aspects:
    Budget-aware design: Explicitly optimizes within budget constraints rather than ignoring them. No other algorithm specifically targets this problem.
    Adaptive temperature: Dynamically adjusts exploration-exploitation balance based on energy transitions, improving convergence.
    Stability detection: Identifies when optimization plateaus, enabling intelligent stopping.
    Simplicity & speed: ~500 lines, minimal dependencies (numpy, networkx), deterministic results unlike probabilistic methods.
    Interpretability: Easy to understand, modify, and integrate into existing workflows.
    Perfect for domains where evaluation cost is prohibitive or real-world constraints mandate limited function calls.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, MySQL, ReactNative and other stuffs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on DoD Network issues and exploiting ChatGPT (I used dislike AI, but it's handy) 
- 🤔 I’m looking for things to take apart (Mainly others things=)
- 💬 Ask me about PantMig, PK, MR,
